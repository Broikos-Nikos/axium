# Axium — Autonomous Linux Assistant

A local-first autonomous AI assistant built in Rust. Runs entirely on your machine at `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. No cloud state, no external databases, no phone-home. Just a fast WebSocket-based chat UI connected to a tool-wielding agent with full system access.

---

## What it does

Axium is a coding and system automation assistant that lives on your Linux machine and can:

- Execute shell commands, run builds, manage git
- Read, write, patch, and search files
- Browse URLs, fetch documentation
- Run tasks in the background with Telegram notifications
- Maintain persistent memory and project knowledge across sessions
- Review its own code changes after each turn
- Understand your Rust project structure via `rust-analyzer` integration

---

## Requirements

- **Rust** (stable, 2021 edition)
- **`rust-analyzer`** CLI — for symbol extraction and AST-aware rename
  ```bash
  rustup component add rust-analyzer
  ```
- **Anthropic API key** — Claude Sonnet (primary model)
- **OpenAI API key** — optional, for classifier/review models (GPT-4.1-mini)

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/axium.git
cd axium
cargo build --release
```

### 2. Create `config.json`

Copy the template and fill in your API keys:

```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
```

```json
{
    "api_keys": {
        "anthropic": "sk-ant-...",
        "openai": "sk-proj-..."
    },
    "models": {
        "primary": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
        "primary_provider": "anthropic",
        "continuation": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
        "continuation_provider": "anthropic",
        "classifier": "gpt-4.1-mini",
        "classifier_provider": "openai",
        "review": "gpt-4.1-mini",
        "review_provider": "openai",
        "subagent": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
        "subagent_provider": "anthropic"
    },
    "agent": {
        "name": "Axium"
    },
    "soul_file": "soul.md",
    "settings": {
        "token_limit": 80000,
        "terminal_timeout_secs": 120,
        "max_output_chars": 15000,
        "max_tool_iterations": 30,
        "max_retries": 2,
        "working_directory": "/home/yourname",
        "conversation_logging": false
    },
    "smtp": {
        "host": "",
        "port": 587,
        "user": "",
        "password": "",
        "from": ""
    },
    "telegram": {
        "bot_token": "",
        "allowed_users": []
    }
}
```

### 3. Customize `soul.md`

The soul file is the agent's system prompt. Edit it freely — it hot-reloads without restart. The included `soul.md` is a good starting point.

### 4. Run

```bash
cargo run --release
# → http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

Or install as a systemd service:

```bash
sudo bash setup.sh
sudo systemctl status axium
```

## Processing Modes

Select the mode in the UI between **New Session** and **Settings**:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Simple** | Prompt goes directly to the primary model. Fast, no overhead. |
| **Supercharge** | GPT-4.1-mini classifies complexity first. Complex tasks get extra planning context. Default for background tasks. |
| **Skills** | LLM scans `axium-skills/` and injects relevant guidelines before responding. Good for domain-specific workflows. |

Mode is stored in browser localStorage — not saved server-side.

---

## Skills System

Create folders under `axium-skills/` with markdown files describing guidelines or domain knowledge:

```
axium-skills/
├── rust-development/
│   └── guidelines.md
├── docker-ops/
│   └── guidelines.md
└── my-project/
    └── conventions.md
```

In **Skills** mode, the classifier reads your message, picks relevant skill folders, and injects their content into the prompt before calling the primary model.

---

## Project Awareness (Rust Projects)

For Rust projects, Axium uses `rust-analyzer` to build a live architecture map on every turn:

```
[ARCHITECTURE]
  agent/
    router.rs [2467L] — fn run_agent_turn→AgentEvent; impl TurnConfig: ...
    sonnet.rs [886L]  — struct SonnetClient{...}; fn build_tools→Vec<Tool>
  tools/
    project.rs [546L] — fn build_project_context→String; fn scan_project→String
```

This is injected into the system prompt automatically — the agent knows your project structure without needing to read individual files first.

The **dependency graph** tool shows file-level imports:

```
get_dependency_graph("src/agent/router.rs", "dependents")
→ Files that import router.rs:
    tui/server.rs
    worker.rs
    channels/telegram.rs
```

Results are cached in `.axium/architecture_cache.json` by file mtime — subsequent calls are instant.

---

## Background Task Queue

Queue long-running tasks that execute in the background:

```
queue_task("Refactor the authentication module and run all tests")
```

A worker process picks up the task, runs the full agent loop, and notifies you via Telegram (if configured) when done. Results persist in SQLite and are shown when you reconnect.

---

## Telegram Integration

Set `telegram.bot_token` and `telegram.allowed_users` in `config.json`. The Telegram channel runs a parallel agent instance — same tools, same memory, same project context. Background task completions are pushed as Telegram notifications.

---

## Autonomous Mode

```
set_autonomous(true)
```

The agent will continue working on its own for up to 10 turns without waiting for user input. Useful for long refactors or multi-step build pipelines. The UI shows progress in real time.

---

## Code Review

After any turn that modifies files, a secondary model runs a silent code review and optionally generates test suggestions. Results are appended to the turn output. Enabled automatically when `review` model is configured.

---

## Security

- **Local-only**: WebSocket handler rejects any non-`127.0.0.1` connection with HTTP 403
- **No cloud state**: All data is SQLite + markdown files on disk
- **Secret-free repo**: `config.json` (API keys, SMTP, Telegram token) is gitignored
- **Process isolation**: Shell commands use `kill_on_drop(true)` and enforced timeouts
